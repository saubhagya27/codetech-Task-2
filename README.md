**Project Overview**

**Title**: 

Simple Linear Regression on California Housing Dataset

**Objective**:

The project aims to predict median house values based on median income using a simple linear regression model. The model is trained on the California Housing dataset, and its performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) metrics.

**Key Activities:**

**Data Loading and Exploration:**

The California Housing dataset was loaded, which includes features like median income, house age, and more.
An initial data exploration was performed to check data types, missing values, and descriptive statistics.

**Feature Selection:**

The feature MedInc (Median Income) was selected as the independent variable (X).
The target variable MedHouseVal (Median House Value) was chosen as the dependent variable (y).

**Data Splitting:**

The dataset was split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for testing.

**Model Training:**

A Linear Regression model was trained on the training data to predict house values based on median income.

**Model Evaluation:**

The model's performance was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) on the test data.

**Visualization:**

The regression line was plotted against the training data to visualize the model's fit.
Actual vs. predicted values on the test data were visualized to assess the accuracy of the model's predictions.

**Technology Used:**

**Programming Language:**

Python

**Libraries:**


**Data Manipulation:**

Pandas, NumPy

**Visualization:**

Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Machine Learning:**

Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)

**Dataset:**

California Housing Dataset from Scikit-learn

**Key Insights:**

The model shows a positive correlation between median income and median house value, as indicated by the regression line.
The R-squared value indicates the proportion of the variance in the median house value that is predictable from the median income.

**Conclusion:**

The simple linear regression model successfully demonstrated the relationship between median income and median house values. The model's performance metrics, such as Mean Squared Error and R-squared, provide a quantitative measure of accuracy. The visualizations confirm that the model reasonably captures the trend in the data, though there may be room for improvement with more complex models or additional features.
